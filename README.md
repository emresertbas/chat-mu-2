# Software Architecture and Design Document 
# ChatMU

1. Introduction

This document describes the high‑level and detailed architecture for an extensible AI application leveraging Semantic Kernel 1.5.8 with PostgreSQL/PGVector to implement chat persistence, high availability, multi‑model integration, multi‑agent orchestration, multi‑vector database support, and extensibility. It also defines a set of OpenAI Codex Tasks to scaffold the GitHub-based project development.

2. Goals and Requirements

2.1 Functional Requirements

Chat Persistence: Store and retrieve conversation history

High Availability: Deploy with zero-downtime updates and failover

Multi‑Model: Integrate multiple LLMs (e.g. GPT-4, Claude)

Multi‑Agent: Orchestrate specialized agents for tasks

Multi‑Vector Database: Support PGVector and external vector stores

Extensibility: Plugin system for new models and agents

2.2 Non‑Functional Requirements

Scalability: Handle thousands of concurrent sessions

Security: Encrypted storage, secure API endpoints

Observability: Metrics, logging, tracing

Maintainability: Modular code, clear interfaces

3. High-Level Architecture

API Gateway (FastAPI)

Orchestration Layer (Semantic Kernel)

Persistence Layer (PostgreSQL + PGVector)

Agent Manager (Custom dispatcher)

Model Connectors (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

Plugin Hook (Dynamic loading)

Infrastructure (Kubernetes, Helm)
